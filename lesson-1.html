If you have ever had to suffer through an internet dropout, chances are you will have seen this page on Google Chrome.<br/>

What you might not know is that pressing the spacebar starts up a little jumping game!<br/>
<img src="images/the_game.png" alt="A screenshot of the offline jumping game available in Chrome"/><br/>
Pressing the spacebar makes the Dino jump so that it can avoid the pesky cacti that get in its way.<br/><br/>
This first lesson will show how you can re-create this game in the Pico-8 Engine!<br/>
<div class="hidden-content" onclick="show_hidden_content(this, '#full-cart')"/></div>
<div id="full-cart" class="hidden">
  The full game is available <a href="resources/pico_8_carts/OfflineDino.p8">here</a>.<br/>
  You can load this game up by copying the p8 file into your 'Carts' folder, then typing 'load offlinedino' into the pico-8 Console<br/>

1. In the Pico-8 Program, press the ESC button to jump from the Console Window to the Pico-8 Editor<br/>

2. To start the program off, we need to setup our games environment
<pre>
  <code class="lua">
    ----- details about the environment
    environment = {}
    -- world gravity
    environment.gravity = -9.83
    -- low bounds of the world
    environment.floor = 50
    -- variable to hold text for debugging purposes
    environment.debug = "a"
    -- workarond for amount of time the system is running
    environment.time = 0
    -- run the main game loop
    environment.playing = true
    ----- spawn stuph
    environment.spawn = {}
    environment.spawn.obstacles = {}
    environment.spawn.timesincelastspawn = 0
  </code>
</pre>
The environment here is used to manage globally available stuff. Constants, gametime, debugging information.<br/>
Having this all available in one place makes it much easier
