Pressing the spacebar makes the Dino jump so that it can avoid the pesky cacti that get in its way.<br/><br/>
This first lesson will show how you can re-create this game in the Pico-8 Engine!<br/>

The full game is available <a href="resources/pico_8_carts/OfflineDino.p8">here</a>.<br/>
You can load this game up by copying the p8 file into your 'Carts' folder, then typing 'load offlinedino' into the pico-8 Console<br/>
