What you might not know is that pressing the spacebar starts up a little jumping game!<br/>
<img src="images/the_game.png" alt="A screenshot of the offline jumping game available in Chrome"/><br/>
Pressing the spacebar makes the Dino jump so that it can avoid the pesky cacti that get in its way.<br/><br/>
This first lesson will show how you can re-create this game in the Pico-8 Engine!<br/>
<div class="hidden-content" onclick="show_hidden_content(this, '#full-cart')"/></div>
<div id="full-cart" class="hidden">
  The full game is available <a href="resources/pico_8_carts/OfflineDino.p8">here</a>.<br/>
  You can load this game up by copying the p8 file into your 'Carts' folder, then typing 'load offlinedino' into the pico-8 Console<br/>

  In the Pico-8 Program, press the ESC button to jump from the Console Window to the Pico-8 Editor<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
    To start the program off, we need to setup our games environment
    <pre>
      <code class="lua">
        ----- details about the environment
        environment = {}
        -- world gravity
        environment.gravity = -9.83
        -- low bounds of the world
        environment.floor = 50
        -- variable to hold text for debugging purposes
        environment.debug = "a"
        -- workarond for amount of time the system is running
        environment.time = 0
        -- run the main game loop
        environment.playing = true
        ----- spawn stuph
        environment.spawn = {}
        environment.spawn.obstacles = {}
        environment.spawn.timesincelastspawn = 0
      </code>
    </pre>
    The environment here is used to manage globally available stuff. Constants, gametime, debugging information.
    Having this all available in one place makes it much easier to make changes later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, we need to setup up 'saur, the official/ unofficial hero(ine) of this game.
    <pre>
      <code class="lua">
      -- our hero, mr 'saur
      dinosaur = {}
      -- unlikely to change, but useful for collision detection
      dinosaur.x = 50
      -- current standing point
      dinosaur.y = environment.floor
      -- highest mr 'saur can jump
      dinosaur.maxjump = 20
      -- in the process of jumping
      dinosaur.jumping = false
      -- current velocity of 'saur's jump
      dinosaur.jumpspeed = 0
      -- amount of time in-air
      dinosaur.timejumping = 0
      -- mr saurs movement sprite
      dinosaur.sprite = 0  
      </code>
    </pre>
    Each of these properties will be used to control our player.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now that 'saur has been developed, we need to give 'saur some logic!
    <pre>
      <code class="lua">
        -- bounding box collision detection
        dinosaur.collide = function()

          }

              xr = __obstacle.x + 7, yr = __obstacle.y + 8
            }

            _str = _str .. "\r\n obs: \r\n"

            then
              return true

          end

          --environment.debug = _str
          return false
        end

        dinosaur.die = function()
          dinosaur.sprite = 3
        end
      </code>
    </pre>
    The big thing here is what is called <a href="http://devmag.org.za/2009/04/13/basic-collision-detection-in-2d-part-1/">Bounding Box Collision</a>. 
    It's a simple physics technique that lets the game know if two boxes intersect (one is somewhat inside the other). 
    If any of the obstacles (cacti here) collide with 'saur, then it's 'Game Over Man'!<br/>
    Also, the '_str' dotted about the place is a way to see what is currently happening in the game.
    As shown here, the debugging information can show where 'saur is, where obstacles are, and when the obstacles spawn and despawn.<br/>
    <img class="gif" src="images/debugging_obstacles.gif" alt="A gif image showing the game debugging obstacles spawning and despawning"><br/>
    The last bit shows the sprite of 'saur when it's game over. More on sprites later!<br/>

    The next few code blocks handle moving various bits about. Moving the player:
    <pre>
      <code class="lua">

<br/>
Now that we have the logic inplace, we need some drawings!<br/>
<img class="gif" src="images/navigate_to_sprite_editor.gif" alt="Navigating to the Sprite Editor"><br/>
Here you fill in blocks of 8X8 pixels to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29">Sprites</a>.<br/>
The Logic we had written earlier will use Sprites 0 - 2 for 'saurs movement, Sprite 3 for 'saurs gameover pose. and 4 for the obstacles.<br/>
<img class="gif" src="images/moving_saur.gif" alt="Moving 'saur"><br/>
Now that we have this all up and running, we can give the game a whirl!
<img src="images/running_the_game.gif" alt="Using the run command" class="gif">
<br/><br/>
If you've made it this far, Conglaturations! A winner is you!<br/>
Y'know what to do next? Have a poke through this code. Change the Sprites. Who knows? Maybe a chicken may want to spend a game jumping over cars!
