  In the first example, we'd seen an example of <a href="http://devmag.org.za/2009/04/13/basic-collision-detection-in-2d-part-1/">Bounding Box Collision</a>.<br/>
  When the player character touched an obstacle, the game ended.<br/>
  For this one, how about we look into the Collision a bit more?<br/>
  <div class="hidden-content" onclick="show_hidden_content(this, '#full-cart')"/></div>
  <div id="full-cart" class="hidden">
    The full demo is available <a href="resources/pico_8_carts/menu_example.p8">here</a>.<br/>
    You can load this game up by copying the p8 file into your 'Carts' folder, then typing 'load menu_example' into the pico-8 Console<br/>
    <img src="images/load_and_run_menu_example.gif" alt="loading and running the menu_example" class="gif">
  </div>
  This lesson will show off a feature of pico-8/lua, where a value can be replaced at any point.<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Firstly, we'll need the main table and a menu table:
      <pre>
        <code class="lua">
game = {}
game_menu = {
  -- Colour for selected menu item
  selected = 1,
  -- Colour for unselected menu item
  not_selected = 9,
  -- three menu items
  menu_items = {
    start = {"test", false, 0, 0, 25, 13, nil},
    first = {"this", false, 0, 15, 25, 28, nil},
    second = {"menu", false, 0, 30, 25, 43, nil}
  },
  mouse = { 0, 0, 0 }
}
        </code>
      </pre>
      What should be noted here is that game shouldn't have anything in it; it's gonna be what pico-8 calls to run all of our cool stuff.
      game_menu in this case is one such thing that will go into game, which we'll see later on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, We need to setup what exactly game_menu will do.
      <pre>
        <code class="lua">
-- when game_menu is the current logic in-use, this will be the update function 
game_menu.update = function()
  game.mouse = { stat(32), stat(33), stat(34) }
  for idx, elem in pairs(game_menu.menu_items) do
    elem[2] =
      between(game.mouse[1], elem[3] + 50, elem[5] + 50) and
      between(game.mouse[2], elem[4] + 30, elem[6] + 30)
    if elem[2] and game.mouse[3] == 1 then
      game = elem[7]
      return
    end
  end
end

-- when game_menu is the current logic in-use, this will be the draw function
game_menu.draw = function()
  local offsetx = 50
  local offsety = 30
  for idx, elem in pairs(game_menu.menu_items) do
    if elem[2] then
      rect(elem[3] + offsetx, elem[4] + offsety,elem[5] + offsetx, elem[6] + offsety, game_menu.selected)
    else
      rect(elem[3] + offsetx, elem[4] + offsety,elem[5] + offsetx, elem[6] + offsety, game_menu.not_selected)
    end
    print(elem[1], elem[3] + 2 + offsetx, elem[4] + 2 + offsety)
  end
  if game.draw_mouse_if_exists then
    game.draw_mouse_if_exists()
  end
end

-- Render the cursor (Sprite 0)
game_menu.draw_mouse_if_exists = function()
  if game.mouse then
    spr(0, game.mouse[1], game.mouse[2])
  end
end
        </code>
      </pre>
      This will draw the menu_items and allow the player to see and click on the items.<br/>
      The mouse drawing stuff is in its own function because it could be used in multiple places (less writing = happier programmers!).
    </li>
    <li>
      This next part is an example of the way lua allows you to just swap stuff in and out. The three menu_items need only have something called 'draw' that _draw -> game.draw() can call as it needs to and the magic just happens!
      <pre>
        <code class="lua">
-- Only implement a draw method
-- These elements do not need update logic
game_start = {}

game_start.draw = function()
  print("start")
end

game_first = {}

game_first.draw = function()
  print("bomb")
end

game_second = {}

game_second.draw = function()
  print("second")
end
        </code>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly for the code, we need to add in the pico-8 functions to actually make all of this come together.
      <pre>
        <code class="lua">
function global_updates()
end

--[[
  On initialisation, set game_menu as the current menu,
  populate the logic of the menu_items,
  listen for mouse input (the 'poke' thing)
]]--
function _init()
  poke(0x5f2d, 1)
  game = game_menu
  game_menu.menu_items.start[7] = game_start
  game_menu.menu_items.first[7] = game_first
  game_menu.menu_items.second[7] = game_second
end

function _update()
  global_updates()
  if game and game.update then
    game.update()
  end
end

function _draw()
  cls()
  if game and game.draw then
    game.draw()
  end
end

function between(val, a, b)
  return val >= a and val <= b
end
        </code>
      </pre>
      There's a few new things here;
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>_init</i> - Initialisation stuff. this runs when your game starts and is useful for preparing the game.<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>poke()</i> - Mouse stuff. 'poke(0x5f2d, 1)' sets up the mouse so that we can get its position every update
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>if game and game.update then</i> - check if something called 'game' exists and that it has the property 'update'. This allows us to safely not bother defining update on game_start, _first, and _second. In programming, this 'is it a thing' kindof test uses whats called <a href="https://forum.roblox.com/Forum/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=52515984">truthiness</a>.
