What you might not know is that pressing the spacebar starts up a little jumping game!

Pressing the spacebar makes the Dino jump so that it can avoid the pesky cacti that get in its way.

This first lesson will show how you can re-create this game in the Pico-8 Engine!
<div class="hidden-content" onclick="show_hidden_content(this, '#full-cart')"/></div>
<div id="full-cart" class="hidden">
  The full game is available [here](resources/pico_8_carts/OfflineDino.p8)
  
  You can load this game up by copying the p8 file into your 'Carts' folder, then typing 'load offlinedino' into the pico-8 Console
