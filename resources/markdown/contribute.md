This website is going to be a collaboration project of Mentors and Students.

By the end of this Project, the Dundalk Coder Dojo will have a front-end (public-facing website) that will give Parents (and curious Senseis) a window into the kinds of stuff taught to the students of this Dojo.  
Additionally, given that everyone should be able to learn at their own pace; this new-fangled website will be a repository for tutorials and resources so that anyone can pick up whatever they wish, whenever the inclination strikes...
